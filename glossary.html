          <h4 style="color:red">10th Street Galleries</h4>
          <p>The 10th Street Galleries were a cooperative collective of galleries that operated between 1952 and 1962. They came about as an avant-garde alternative to the Madison Avenue and 57th Street galleries that were both conservative and highly selective. The galleries were artist run and generally operated on very low budgets, often without any staff. It comprised approximately 250 artists who were dues-paying members of these co-operative galleries. Several older and more established artists such as Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline maintained studios nearby, and often served a supporting role for the many younger artists who gravitated to this scene. Some artists became members of more than one gallery.</p>

          <h4 style="color:red">The Living Theater</h4>
          <p>The Living Theatre was founded in 1947 by Judith Malina(1926-)
            The Living Theatre is an American theater company that was founded in 1947 by actress Judith Malina and New York School painter/poet Julian Beck. It is the oldest experimental theater group in the United States. The Living Theatre is known for its experiential art, social engagement, and commentary on contemporary issues. 
            After a number of incarnations around the city and the world, the theater eventually landed in the East Village in May 1989, when Judith Malina and Hanon Reznikov opened again on Third Street in Manhattan with Armand Schwerner's The Tablets. It was the Theatre's first New York home in 26 years and where they continue to perform.
