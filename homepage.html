<h2>An epicenter of critical subversion and artistic experimentation</h2>

    <div id="pdisplay">
      <p> All members of this project group have either lived in or studied the East Village at different points in time spanning from the early 1990s through to 2024. The neighborhood’s cultural significance as an epicenter of artistic creativity and counterculture has been a source of inspiration for generations.
        We are united in our passion for preserving and celebrating the artistic tradition and history of the area, which has been rapidly and continually changed by gentrification. To help ensure that the neighborhood’s creative heritage isn’t lost to time, we have gathered information about some of the major figures of important artistic movements generated by the rich community that became possible in the area when comparatively lower rent to income ratio in the area made contemplation and community gathering and experimentation possible.
